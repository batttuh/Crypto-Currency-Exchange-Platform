Any partial payment of an invoice will be deemed notice by Company of the disputed amount, unless such partial payment is in accordance with payment terms contained in the applicable Schedule for Work. All disputed amounts that Company subsequently agrees in writing to pay, or that are required to be paid pursuant to a proper court order or award from any mutually submitted arbitration, will be paid on the payment terms set forth in Section 5 above. Payment of an invoice without asserting a dispute is not a waiver of any claim or right.

"14.1 Developer Responsibility for Taxes. The amounts to be paid by Company to Developer herein do not include any value-added tax, business tax or any other indirect and direct taxes arising as a result of or in connection with the transactions contemplated under this Agreement. To the extent applicable, Developer agrees to pay all applicable taxes levied on it by a duly constituted and authorized taxes authority on the transactions covered under this Agreement. To the extent required by any such taxing authority , Developer may collect such taxes, if any, from Company solely based on the amounts payable under this Agreement (such taxes the “Collected Taxes”), and in such case, company shall remit to Company official tax certificates indicating that such taxes have been collected by Developer and submitted to the appropriate tax authorities. Developer will take such steps as are requested by Company to minimize such Collected Taxes in accordance with all relevant laws and to cooperate with and assist Company, at Company’s request, in challenging the validity of any Collected Taxes or taxes otherwise paid by Company. Developer will equally share the cost of any successful Company-initiated ruling and/or appeal or other determination that concludes that the Collected Taxes are not owed in whole or in part under this Agreement. When Developer receives the payment from Company, Developer should issue formal tax receipts for Company income tax deduction purpose. Developer will indemnify and hold Company harmless from any Collected Taxes, penalties, interest, or additions to tax arising from amounts paid by Company to Developer under this Agreement, that are asserted or assessed against Company to the extent such amounts relate to amounts that are paid to or collected by Developer from Company under this section. If any taxing authority refunds any tax to Developer which Company originally paid to Developer, or Developer otherwise becomes aware that any tax was incorrectly and/or erroneously collected from Company, or Developer otherwise receives an economic benefit (including an audit offset) as the result of incorrectly and/or erroneously receiving Collected Taxes from Company, then Developer will promptly remit to Company an amount equal to such refund, incorrect collection or tax benefit as the case may be, plus any interest thereon.\n" +

"14.2 Withholding. If taxes are required to be withheld on any amounts otherwise to be paid by Company to Developer, Company may deduct such taxes from the amount otherwise owed and pay them to the appropriate taxing authority. At Developer’s written request and expense, Company will use reasonable efforts to cooperate with and assist Developer in obtaining tax certificates or other appropriate documentation, evidencing such payment, provided, however, that the responsibility for such documentation will remain with Developer.\n" +
"\n" +
"14.3 Developer Employees. The parties agree that any workers who are engaged by Developer and perform Work (“Workers”) will be employees of Developer and not of Company or its subsidiaries for all purposes, including without limitation workers’ compensation, taxes, compensation and employee benefits. Developer will make all applicable employment and payroll tax withholdings and payments with respect to such Workers’ compensation, and Company will not be responsible to provide the Workers with any compensation or employee benefits.\n" +

"15.1 Independent Contractor. Developer is an independent contractor for Company. Nothing in this Agreement will be construed as creating an employer-employee relationship, partnership or joint venture, as a guarantee of future employment or projects, as a limitation upon Company’s sole discretion to terminate this Agreement at any time without cause, or as creating an exclusive relationship or minimum commitment. Developer is not authorized to assume, create or incur any liability on behalf of Company.\n" +
"\n" +
"15.2 Notices. All notices and requests in connection with this Agreement will be deemed given as of the day they are received either by messenger, delivery service, or in the United States of America mails, postage prepaid, certified or registered, return receipt requested, and addressed to those contained in this Agreement or such other address as the party to receive the notice or request so designates by written notice to the other.\n" +

"\n" +
"\n" +
"15.3 Assignment. Developer may not assign this Agreement, or any rights or obligations hereunder, whether by operation of contract, law or otherwise, except with the express written consent of Company, and any attempted assignment by Developer in violation of this section will be void. For purposes of this Agreement, an “assignment” by Developer under this section will be deemed to include, without limitation, each of the following: (a) a change in beneficial ownership of Developer of greater than twenty percent (20%) (whether in a single transaction or series of transactions) if Developer is a partnership, trust, limited liability company or other like entity; (h) a merger of Developer with another party, whether or not Developer is the surviving entity; (c) the acquisition of more than twenty percent (20%) of any class of Developer’s voting stock (or any class of non-voting security convertible into voting stock) by another party (whether in a single transaction or series of transactions); and (d) the sale or other transfer of more than fifty percent (50%) of Developer’s assets (whether in a single transaction or series of transactions). In the event of such assignment or attempted assignment by Developer, Company will have the right to immediately terminate this Agreement.\n" +

"15.5 Construction. This Agreement does not constitute an offer by Company and it will not be effective until signed by both parties. This Agreement (including any Schedules) constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work and all other subject matter hereof and merges all prior and contemporaneous communications. It may not be modified except by a written agreement signed on behalf of Developer and Company by their respective duly authorized representatives. Any party’s delay or failure to require performance of any provision of this Agreement will not in any way diminish or prejudice the right of such party to require performance of that provision, and any waiver by a party of a breach of any provision of this Agreement will not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach of this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then it will be enforced to the maximum extent permitted to effectuate its original purpose, and the remainder of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.\n" +
